This program is for handling the database through the Flask app via Docker.

To use, just write "docker-compose up"in the terminal.
Then you'll be able to check the data table through "http://localhost address/person" 

Using POST, you can add a person's data (id, age, name) in Json form. 
Using GET, you can call the data that has updated. 
(You can test it through REST test programs.)
